## Classes
### :dk:  Death Knight
New Glowing Buttons
- Blood Tap, with 5+ charges of Blood Charge (Mists of Pandaria)
- Soul Reaper, when the target has low hp (Mists of Pandaria)

There are three Soul Reaper options, one for each spec.

By default, Soul Reaper's execute threshold is 35% of the target's health. This threshold increases to 45% health when the Death Knight equips 4+ pieces of the tier 15 set bonus.
