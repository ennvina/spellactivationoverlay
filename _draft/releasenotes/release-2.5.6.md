@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.6
## General
## Classes
### :paladin:  Paladin
New Spell Alert
- The Art of War (Mists of Pandaria)
## Bug Fixes
### :druid:  Druid
Druids no longer get error from loading Eclipse Moon and Eclipse Sun textures at start (Mists of Pandaria).
### :hunter:  Hunter
The following abilities would not always glow
- Counterattack (Era, TBC, Wrath)
- Mongoose Bite (Era, TBC)

This issue happens only if all the following conditions are met at the same time
- The ability is Rank 2 or higher
- The Hunter has reloaded their interface after learning Rank 2
- The "Show all spell ranks" option is disabled in the Spellbook
### :paladin:  Paladin
The following spells would not always glow
- Exorcism (Era, TBC, Wrath)

### :warrior:  Warrior
The following abilities would not always glow
- Warrior's Execute (Era, TBC, Wrath)
- Warrior's Overpower (Era, TBC)
- Warrior's Revenge (Era, TBC, Wrath)

This issue happens only if all the following conditions are met at the same time
- The ability is Rank 2 or higher
- The Warrior has reloaded their interface after learning Rank 2
- The respective options are setup to the exclusive stance(s) they can be cast in

As an example of the latter condition, Overpower could fail to glow if its option was set to "Battle Stance only" and would correctly glow if the option was set to "All stances".
