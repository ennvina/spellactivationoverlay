# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.4
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.4
## General
### Options Panel
The class name is displayed at one place in the options panel, instead of each time for each spell alert and each glowing button.
## Classes
### :mage~1:  Mage
Removed Glowing Buttons
- Ice Lance\*, during Fingers of Frost (Mists of Pandaria)
- Deep Freeze\*, during Fingers of Frost (Mists of Pandaria)

\* These buttons are already glowing by the game client. Please note, it only concerns Fingers of Frost. Ice Lance and Deep Freeze will continue to glow for the Freeze debuff, because the game client does not glow Ice Lance nor Deep Freeze in this case.
### :warrior:  Warrior
The Warrior class is now fully supported for Mists of Pandaria!

New Spell Alerts
- Victory Rush (Mists of Pandaria)
- Taste for Blood (Mists of Pandaria)
- Sudden Death (Mists of Pandaria)
- Bloodsurge (Mists of Pandaria)
- Sword and Board (Mists of Pandaria)
- Ultimatum (Mists of Pandaria)

New Glowing Buttons
- Overpower\*, during Taste for Blood (Mists of Pandaria)
- Victory Rush\*, during Victorious (Mists of Pandaria)
- Impending Victory, during Victorious (Mists of Pandaria)

\* Overpower and Victory Rush were already supported, but as a _counter_. Now they are based on buffs instead. They also have spell alerts now. If these overlays are popular enough, they might end up in other flavors as well.

Removed Glowing Buttons\*\*
- Execute (Mists of Pandaria)
- Revenge (Mists of Pandaria)

\*\* These buttons already glow natively in Mists of Pandaria
## Bug Fixes
### :mage~1:  Mage
The Freeze effect would always glow Ice Lance and Deep Freeze (Mists of Pandaria). Options for their respective buttons have been added.
### :shaman:  Shaman
Animations of Fulmination (Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria) and Rolling Thunder (Season of Discovery) are now on par with other animations.

Shamans should no longer get invited to report unsupported effect Maelstrom (Mists of Pandaria).
### :warrior:  Warrior
Warriors should no longer get invited to report the following unsupported effects (Mists of Pandaria):
- Sudden Death
- Bloodsurge
- Sword and Board
- Ultimatum
## Known Limitations
## Miscellaneous
