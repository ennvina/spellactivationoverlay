# SpellActivationOverlay 2.7.1
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.7.1
## General
### Game Updates
This release includes support for Titan Reforged: Wrath!

Due to the difficulty to test Titan Reforged servers, support is limited. More than ever, make sure to report issues. Thank you :)
## Bug Fixes
### Universal build
The Universal build is no longer seen as 'out of date' (The Burning Crusade). In other words, it is no longer required to check the 'Load out of date AddOns' from the AddOns list.
### Developer build
The Developer build is no longer seen as 'out of date' (Classic Era, The Burning Crusade, Wrath, Cataclysm). In other words, it is no longer required to check the 'Load out of date AddOns' from the AddOns list.
