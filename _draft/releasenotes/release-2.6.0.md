# SpellActivationOverlay 2.6
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.6

This release bumps TOC files, fixes a couple of issues, and introduced a new type of Spell Alert.
## General
### Spell Alerts
This release introduces a new type of Spell Alert: Shared Spell Alerts
- Usually, Spell Alerts are exclusive to the player's class toolkit
- For example, Hot Streak is a Mage alert, and only Mages can have it
- Shared Spell Alerts, on the other hand, are available to all classes
- For example, Leap of Faith is cast by Priests but anyone can be the recipient
## Classes
### :recycle:  Shared
- Priest's Leap of Faith (Mists of Pandaria)
- Druid's Leap of Faith (Mists of Pandaria)
### :druid:  Druid
New Spell Alert
- Mangle! (Mists of Pandaria)

New Glowing Button
- Mangle (Bear form), during Mangle! (Mists of Pandaria)
### :warlock:  Warlock
New Spell Alert
- Mannoroth's Fury (Mists of Pandaria)

New Glowing Buttons
- Hellfire, during Mannoroth's Fury (Mists of Pandaria)
- Rain of Fire, during Mannoroth's Fury (Mists of Pandaria)
- Seed of Corruption, during Mannoroth's Fury (Mists of Pandaria)
## Bug Fixes
### General
The question asked at start triggered an error (Mists of Pandaria PTR).
### :mage~1:  Mage
Checking talents at start triggered an error (Classic Era), with presumably no issues besides the message.
### :priest:  Priest
Checking talents at start triggered an error (Classic Era), which could prevent Shadowform from working correctly.
### :rogue:  Rogue
Checking talents at start triggered an error (Classic Era), which could prevent Riposte from working correctly.
### :shaman:  Shaman
Checking talents at start triggered an error (Classic Era), with presumably no issues besides the message.
## Known Limitations
### :druid:  Druid
Hovering the cursor over the option of the Mangle glowing button will preview the glowing effect only when the Druid is in Bear form (Mists of Pandaria).
