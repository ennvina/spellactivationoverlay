# SpellActivationOverlay 2.6.1
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.6.1

This release bumps TOC file, fixes a few issues and greatly improves performance.
## General
## Game Updates
This release bumps TOC file for Throne of Thunder update (Mists of Pandaria).

This releases scratches the surface of The Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary. The addon was prepared (!) for quite some time now, but Blizzard being bizarre (as usual), something broke overnight and must be fixed before an official release. Stay tuned!
## Classes
### :warlock:  Warlock
New Spell Alert
- Soul Swap (Mists of Pandaria)

New Glowing Button
- Soul Swap: Exhale, during Soul Swap\* (Mists of Pandaria)

\* More exactly, the _Exhale_ button glows while the Warlock holds the 3-second buff gained after _inhaling_ debuffs.
## Bug Fixes
### :hunter:  Hunter
Mongoose Bite should now always trigger as intended (Classic Era).
### :rogue:  Rogue
Riposte should now trigger as intended (Classic Era).
## Known Limitations
Glowing buttons currently do not work (The Burning Crusade). This does not affect other expansions.
## Miscellaneous
The addon underwent major performance improvements. Loading times should be identical but CPU usage is much lower. Overall, the addon uses 2x less CPU in 25-man raids. See images below which compare a full-length Un'sok heroic encounter in a 25-man raid from a warlock point of view (lower is better). Improvements may vary based on the situation such as player class, raid size, and encounter, but performance should always be better when comparing the same situation before and after this update.

The addon's description, seen in the game's addon selection page, has been translated in all languages. Feel free to report mistakes.
