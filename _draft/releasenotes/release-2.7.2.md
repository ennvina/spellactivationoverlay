# SpellActivationOverlay 2.7.2
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.7.2
## General
## Classes
### :recycle:  Shared
Healing Trance visuals have been updated (The Burning Crusade, Wrath).

_Developer's Note: Previously, Healing Trance shared visuals with other Clearcasting effects. Therefore, it was not easy to identify which effect was triggered. New visuals should be different enough to indicate which visuals belong to which buff, yet they should be close enough to know that their effects are related i.e., they lower the mana cost of the next spell cast._
### :priest:  Priest
New Spell Alerts
- Clearcasting (The Burning Crusade)

New Glowing Buttons
- Binding Heal, during Clearcasting (The Burning Crusade)
- Flash Heal, during Clearcasting (The Burning Crusade)
- Greater Heal, during Clearcasting (The Burning Crusade)
## :shaman:  Shaman
New Spell Alerts
- Shaman's Shamanistic Focus\* (The Burning Crusade, Wrath, Cataclysm)

New Glowing Buttons
- Shaman's Earth Shock, during Shamanistic Focus\* (The Burning Crusade, Wrath, Cataclysm)
- Shaman's Flame Shock, during Shamanistic Focus\* (The Burning Crusade, Wrath, Cataclysm)
- Shaman's Frost Shock, during Shamanistic Focus\* (The Burning Crusade, Wrath, Cataclysm)

\* Shamanistic Focus is disabled by default and must be enabled from the options panel: `/sao`

Elemental Focus visuals are now consistent across expansions and across Clearcasting effects in general.

_Developer's Note: Elemental Focus visuals of Cataclysm and beyond have not changed. Visuals of Classic Era, The Burning Crusade and Wrath are now on par with Cataclysm. Some Shamans may feel that the new visuals are now a bit dull on these flavors. On the other hand, Shamans playing across several flavors should welcome this change, because visuals will be much less confusing when switching between expansions._
## Bug Fixes

## Miscellaneous
This release optimizes code size a bit further than in 2.7.0.
