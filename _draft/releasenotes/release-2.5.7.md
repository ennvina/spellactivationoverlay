# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.7
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.7
## General
### Options Panel
Players who opted out to disable the game's spell alerts can choose to ask the question again (Mists of Pandaria). If you would close the dialog box by mistake and would like to answer the question
- open the Options Panel, either by going to Options > AddOns > SpellActivationOverlay, or by typing `/sao`
- check the combo box named "Detect conflicts with the game's spell alerts"
## Classes
### :monk:  Monk
New Spell Alert
- Vital Mists (Mists of Pandaria)

Updated Spell Alerts
- Blackout Kick is now only displayed right (Mists of Pandaria)
- Tiger Palm is now green-ish and displayed left (Mists of Pandaria)
### :paladin:  Paladin
Removed Glowing Buttons
- Hammer of Wrath (Mists of Pandaria)
- Holy Shock, during Daybreak (Mists of Pandaria)
- Divine Light, during Infusion of Light (Mists of Pandaria)
- Holy Light, during Infusion of Light (Mists of Pandaria)
- Holy Radiance, during Infusion of Light (Mists of Pandaria)
- Avenger's Shield, during Grand Crusader (Mists of Pandaria)

_Developer's Note: These buttons are already glowing by the game client. When players unchecked such buttons in the addon's options panel, it was confusing because the buttons were still glowing even though the player asked explicitly not to. Since the addon cannot prevent the game client from glowing buttons, the wise choice is to simply remove these buttons from the addon._

## Bug Fixes
## Known Limitations
## Miscellaneous
All checkboxes are now translated at the bottom of the Options Panel.
