# SpellActivationOverlay 2.5.5
@here I am pleased to announce the newest release of SpellActivationOverlay, version 2.5.5
## General
There now a _Universal_ build that works for all flavors: Era, Cataclysm, etc.

Pros:
- Download only one build and use it everywhere
- No more questions whether the right flavor was downloaded - by definition, Universal is always the right build

Cons:
- Bigger than any flavor - around 25% bigger than Vanilla, as of today
- Slightly slower to load - but not slower in combat, don't worry!

Specific flavors will still be available. In fact, they are still recommended, especially when playing a unique flavor.
